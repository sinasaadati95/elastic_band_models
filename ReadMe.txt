The idea of solving convex hull problem by modeling and simulation of an elastic band has been done with developement of model using two softwares:
1- Java, An object-oriented programming language. You can find this model in a folder called Java.
2- RepastSimphony, A tool for developing agent-based models. You can find this model in 'Repast Simphony'.
